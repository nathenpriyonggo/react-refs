# React Timer Challenge

This is a React project designed to practice working with refs and portals. 
The game challenges users to stop a timer as close as possible to the target time. 
It demonstrates state management, event handling, refs for managing timers, and portals 
for rendering modals efficiently. This project provides hands-on experience with useRef, 
useImperativeHandle, and React Portals.
